The Messages and Case Studies sections revealed a number of messages emerging from the various types of analysis carried out in REEEM. Although those messages can be relevant for both the scientific community and policy-makers, further actions must be taken in order to integrate and communicate. The objectives of the synthesis and outreach process are:
*	Elicit integrated (i.e. cross-sectoral) messages that can help define the direction of policy making from a broader perspective.
*	Communicate all messages (and the supporting material such as data and background information) in a way that promotes transparency, reproducibility, wide engagement and educational aspects.
To fulfil the above objectives, the outcome of REEEM is shaped into the following five products:
*	Synthesis of messages: An attempt to draw broader messages, emerging from the co-analysis of the messages presented in Section 3 for the EU as a whole and for the case studies. This action helps fulfil the first objective of the synthesis and outreach process.
*	REEEM Database: An open source database to store all the modelling outputs relevant to the integrated impact assessment and the underlying input data (as far as openly available). This product, as well as all the following ones, aim at fulfilling the second objective of the evaluation.
*	OSeMBE: The Open Source energy Model Base for the EU is an open-source, low-threshold model of the energy system of the EU28 + Norway and Switzerland built in the open source modelling framework OSeMOSYS REF. It is used as stakeholder engagement model.
*	REEEMgame: A serious game aimed at interactively taking experts and non-experts through key dynamics of transitions to a low-carbon energy system. 
*	REEEMpathways: An online free and open platform showcasing the three REEEM pathways and the related messages defined in Section 3 and 4.1.

Figure XX below depicts how the aforementioned products are linked. The data used in the REEEM integrated framework is fed into the database. At the same time, OSeMBE also takes data from and harmonises assumptions with the integrated framework. The data produced for and by OSeMBE is then also fed into the database. The latter, then, facilitates the development of the REEEMgame and the REEEMpathways by providing data and messages from OSeMBE and the integrated framework respectively.

## Synthesis of messages

This sub-section describes the integrated messages emerging from the synthesis of the insights given in Section 3.

**Integrated message 1: Multi-dimensional impacts of the transition to a low carbon EU energy system - A story of costs and benefits**

The high decarbonisation targets set by the European Union will have direct impacts on the development of the energy sector and indirect impacts on environment, economies and societies. Those impacts though, are not expected to manifest unanimously across the different member states, sectors of the economy or even regions within a country. Various trajectories are expected to unfold, leading to particular groups benefiting from the transition while others seeing detrimental effects. Firstly, in all pathways, economic growth (measured by GDP) is expected to be uneven across member states, without necessarily being skewed towards a particular geographic area. At the same time, when examining health impacts, Central European countries such as Germany and Poland seem to benefit the most from the transition, as they see their DALY decrease the most. Similarly, affordability (defined as the capacity of households to bear the energy expenditure to heat their properties) is another key factor indicating that not all EC countries will perform equally. Greece, Bulgaria and Lithuania are expected to record the lowest scores in that metric, due to lower quality of thermal insulation. 
The discrepancies in terms of affordability, as well as unemployment rate, may be even more pronounced when one looks at different regions within a country (e.g. Yugoiztochen (BG) which is region currently featuring high employment in energy intensive sectors).  The same may be said in terms of unintended environmental impacts. The study on the impact of high decarbonisation strategies on local ecosystems for Lithuania provides a clear case: strategies aiming at high shares of biomass in primary energy supply to curb GHGs emissions potentially open the path for intensive uses of such source. These in turn may cause irreversible damage to the ecosystem and, ultimately, to the economy of local communities, resulting in strong opposition to low-carbon national strategies. The latter is a clear indication that national strategies and targets may have dramatic effects if they are designed top-down without accounting for regional impacts. Moreover, even when GDP shows a considerable growth in a particular country, not every sector follows the same trajectory. Both in terms of gross added value to the national economy, as well as in terms of employment rate, some sectors are expected to thrive (e.g. non-metallic minerals and vehicles), while industries such as coal will be highly affected in a negative way. Therefore, in order for a strategy to be thoroughly evaluated and deemed positive, several impacts need to be interrogated at various levels and a multi-criteria decisional approach must be followed.
The expected diverse impacts between and within Member States indicate risks but also opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon EU society. At a national level, as there will be “winners” and “losers” a stronger union could emerge in an attempt to minimise the impacts. Policies supporting freedom of movement re-training/re-focusing of skills within sectors will be needed. This will require strong EC intervention, creating an opportunity to advance faster in the two dimensions of the Energy Union: 1) Security, solidarity and trust and 2) Fully-integrated internal energy market. Hence, addressing it effectively could provide a competitive edge.

**Integrated message 2: Broader engagement is imperative for deep decarbonisation**

As it turns out from the analysis carried out in REEEM, deep decarbonisation requires active contribution from a plethora of actors. Given the complexity of energy systems and the number of actors that can influence their course in different ways, decisions made merely by central governments could lead to a high cost transition with various negative impacts. The penetration of certain technologies (e.g. renewables) has to increase, which depends not only on government support, but also on RnD investments by businesses, funding schemes and mechanisms by certain funds, public acceptance and a shift in market structure and mindset. Citizens’ behaviour in particular and the choices they make will be a key factor in the evolution of the system. 

Concepts such as circular economy, more efficient logistics and recycling need to be regulated at all levels of the energy supply-consumption chains, especially for segment of the supply expected to rely heavily on rare materials. An example is the platinum group metals (PGM) which could be replacing platinum with palladium, while from rare earths an example would be substituting samarium for dysprosium.

Moreover, government decisions should be made in conjunction with both sub- and transnational stakeholders in order to account for different issues which are critical for the development of the system. For example, a national government needs to consider the system characteristics of neighboring countries when a high load is expected to be transmitted through interconnectors as part of a broader energy security strategy. At the same time, regional development (e.g. district heating systems) may help reduce GHG emissions and thus, governments could engage more with local stakeholders to better understand what schemes would benefit certain projects. The same applies to the EC strategy which could benefit from delving deeper into national realities and hence, exploit the strengths of each member state and adjust the goals accordingly. For instance, a universal, binding decarbonisation target could lead to countries that have a high potential reducing emissions to a degree that does not correspond to their capabilities while others with a lower potential could undergo a significantly high-cost transition.

Broader engagement may present the European Union with an opportunity to accelerate the transition to low-carbon societies. A higher level of engagement can be helped by science-informed discussions, open and transparent analytical tools and dissemination towards all interested actors. 

**Integrated message 3: The EU low-carbon transition is linked to non-EU drivers**

To be effective, the deep decarbonisation of the EU energy sector would need to take into account trajectories outside the EU. As revealed in the REEEM analysis, a number of technologies (e.g. lighting, renewables and electric vehicles) which are expected to play a catalytic role in the transition, rely heavily on critical materials. The latter are, for the most part, concentrated and produced in regions beyond the EU borders. Therefore, given the limited control that the EC may have over the exploitation of those materials, certain development plans -linked to the aforementioned technologies- could be put at risk. Judicious use of critical material resources at a global level is expected to be a determinant of global decarbonisation and thus, a greater level of cooperation and potentially regulation could help reduce risk of material scarcity/overheated prices.

The development rates of technologies used in the EU energy system are, to some extent, linked to decarbonisation targets and supporting schemes in different parts of the world. Therefore, decarbonisation targets in the EU and outside may impact exports and consequently competitiveness in the EU and outside. Leveraging on the different market shares world regions have in different parts of the technology value chains could positively impact competitiveness and, ultimately, cooperation between regions. 

**Integrated message 4: Marginal cost vs marginal benefits of low-carbon transition and implications**

As mentioned in the previous messages, deep decarbonisation is expected to have significant impacts on the economy and society. The study on macroeconomic impacts in particular, illustrates how the fulfilment of the Paris Agreement could hinder GDP growth more compared to other pathways where the ambition for curbing emissions is lower. This is accompanied by a roughly 10% higher consumption of critical materials (compared to the Coalition for a low carbon path pathway) as well as biomass and water. At the same time, when the Paris Agreement target is achieved, there is an incremental increase in the relevant benefits such as lower health impacts. Comparing the marginal cost to the marginal benefits of the transition to a significantly low-carbon pattern is not a straightforward process as it depends heavily on the perspective of each actor engaging in the decision-making. It is therefore critical, as mentioned in previous messages, to assess the pros and cons diligently, not only with regards to how the transition should materialise (i.e. which countries/regions/sectors to be affected the most) but also up to which level of decarbonisation the benefits are considered greater than the cost. While decarbonisation to a certain level can be achieved without fundamental changes to the system (i.e. by exploiting the “low hanging fruits” such as energy efficiency), raising the ambition level from 95% to 100% decarbonisation may bear a significantly high marginal cost. If the latter was to be achieved, a net balance  could be examined (i.e. integrate methods that remove CO2 from the atmosphere) and the cost would be significantly high.

Another aspect that needs to be taken into account is that, when the life cycle carbon footprint of technologies is examined (taking into account indirect emissions), the actual decarbonisation rate is lower than the one shown by direct emissions. EU decarbonisation targets are at risk of incentivising indirect-carbon leakage towards other regions of the world, if global strategies towards the reduction of emissions along the entire value chains are not set up. In addition to that, given that besides the local benefits, the overarching target of reducing GHG emissions is a global issue, one could examine whether the marginal cost of investing in reducing the emissions outside the EU is lower and the marginal, global benefits (as well as those for the EU economy) higher.

Lastly, the higher the need for electrification of sectors of the economy, the more the need for baseload generation rises . CCS, biomass and/or nuclear could represent the most affordable low-carbon options for such purpose. Especially if 100% decarbonisation of industry results hardly feasible, biomass coupled with CCS may represent a CO2-negative option to pursue net-zero emissions in the EU by 2050. For different reasons, the use of the above technologies has been debated in the EU as they have environmental, social and economic impacts that go beyond GHG emissions. The shares of baseload generation technologies could be contained by investing in high capacity of flexible generation options, including grid-connected storage, smart end-use technologies and increase of interconnections between Member States. The appropriate mix between these options does not depend upon cost and investment considerations, but also highly on security concerns, long-term purchase agreements and, not least, affordability of electricity prices. A larger base of comprehensive studies on the cross-sectoral and cross-scale implications of different mix of flexible and low-carbon generation options is needed to inform investments and policy decisions (such as those on capacity markets or support towards specific technological solutions). It worth noting also, -based on the above analysis- that where budget for decarbonisation is limited, it might be worthwhile considering whether reducing emissions along the value chains - even those now accounted as outside-EU - could be a more cost-effective option.

**Integrated message 5: Among the technology trends, sectoral integration, energy efficiency and electrification of transportation consistently confirmed as potential enablers of the decarbonisation**

Few technology trends emerge as potential drivers of deep decarbonisation, consistently with previous study. Electrification of several energy supply chains is a robust finding in REEEM as in previous efforts. It may be allocated efficiently between decentralised and centralised sources, depending on the availability of primary and renewable resources and on the potential for cross-boundary transmission. Potential for electrification emerges in industry, through increased power-to-heat uses, and in the transportation sector.

Road transportation has high potential for decarbonisation and electrification. At the same time though, the associated, negative, system-wide impacts are not trivial. As revealed by the study on health impacts and LCA, when it comes to particulate matter emissions (derived from road abrasion, tyres and break wear), electric vehicles are no more environmentally friendly than those that run on fossil fuels. On top of that, EVs are heavy reliant on critical materials which -as discussed in the current report- may have various implications. Consequently, if those impacts are accounted for and stricter regulations are set in place (with regards to either the use of critical materials or particulate emissions limits), the potential of EVs to curb emissions might be reduced significantly. Recycling and efficient use of materials may represent a way to reduce impacts. Furthermore, expansion of public transportation and, in general, a shift across modes of transportation may lead to a decrease in the use of resources for meeting transportation service demands. These have to be evaluated face potential behavioural barriers on the consumers side. Surveys in three Member States have shown that consumers consistently tend to hold onto the same type of vehicle even when it does not represent the cost- or environment-optimal alternative. Support for information campaigns, eco-labelling and easy costing of choices could help win the inertia. Finally, further research in order for new technologies to emerge might be critical for the vehicle sector to overcome those issues. 

In the residential sector, one low-hanging fruit for deep decarbonisation is represented by energy efficiency, especially through renovation of buildings. Technologically mature measures are available at low cost. Constraints to the pace of renovation seem to come mostly from the absence of business models and incomplete regulations.

## REEEM Database
In the REEEM project, a large group of modelling teams from different institutes have developed used and linked different software with different programming languages and modelling paradigms. This results in a large variety of data structures. In the integrated assessment modelling framework of REEEM, data from different sectors are used and created, of different types, formats and with different levels of aggregation. In addition, as the REEEM pathways are iteratively revised (as described in Section 2), the input and output data of each model need to be revised several times throughout the project, too. This requires modellers to upload and download data to and from the database frequently. Finally, several models are soft-linked and some are iterated (such as NEWAGE and TIMES PanEU). Data versioning is crucial in order to ensure consistency in the inputs and outputs exchanged between the models and, ultimately, in the formulation of the REEEM pathways (see Section 2). 

Thus, the project database needs to meet different requirements. Besides complying with basic data security and access regulations as described in the Data Management Plan (D6.6), the structure must be flexible and database usage should be as automated and comfortable for modellers as possible. This challenge was solved by developing scripts for importing and exporting data to and from the project database, customised for each modelling team according to their data structures and formats. All open support documentation from the different data processing and modelling activities are either available on GitHub or in the relevant open access publications.

The above complexities also lead to challenges in the data classification and categorisation. These were solved by developing and implementing a flexible tagging system for model inputs and outputs. This allows for data in the database to be tagged with different tags, assigned by modellers and users according to their understanding of the meaning of the data. The flexible tagging prevents rigid categorisations of data according to definitions which may not be commonly understood by users with different background. For instance, data related to … 

Besides the technical aspects, the legal aspects were considered as well. The project aims at publishing the data sets under open licenses. All openly licensed input and output data of the models and pathways (of the REEEMPathways tool) in the REEEM database are publicly available also on the OpenEnergyPlatform (OEP) and can then be identified under the tag “REEEM”. The links between the REEEM Database and other REEEM activities as well as with the OEP are shown below in Figure XX. The database concept and the data structures are presented in great detail in the Technical Documentation of the REEEM Pathway Database (D6.5).

## OSeMBE: Open Source energy Model Base for the EU

The Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS) was used to build the Open Source energy Model Base for the European Union (OSeMBE). Within the scope of REEEM, OSeMBE is configured as a model of the electricity system of the EU28, with addition of Norway and Switzerland, covering a time span from current years until 2050. OSeMBE, its code base, its input data and metadata and all related documentation are available on REEEM.org as well as on the OSeMOSYS community’s website. Its factsheet (summary of key information for model comparison purposes) is also available on the Open Energy Platform, managed by the Open Energy Modelling Initiative according to best practices of open modelling science. The model is documented in REEEM report D7.3.

OSeMBE is purposefully and in accordance with the Grant Agreement of REEEM designed as a stakeholder engagement model. As such, it aims to illustrate to expert and non-expert stakeholders key dynamics of the transition to a low-carbon EU energy system featured in TIMES PanEU, however leaving out its detail and complexity. Its structure includes the 28 EU member states, Norway and Switzerland as connected regions. Each region has a set of technologies and fuels available and can exchange electricity with its neighbours. The energy resources considered are: liquid biofuels, solid biomass, coal, geothermal energy, heavy fuel oil, natural gas, oil, oil shale, solar energy, uranium, waste, waves, and wind. The model distinguishes between domestic resources and imported resources. The resources can be converted to electricity by using combined cycle power plants (PPs), CHP PPs, fuel cells, gas cycle PPs, integrated gasification combined cycle PPs, internal combustion engines, nuclear reactors of generation II and III, solar photovoltaic, steam cycle PPs, and wind turbines. The model covers the years 2015 to 2050. Per year it has five seasons and one typical day per season represented by three time slices. To allow the analysis of the environmental impact of the power system, CO2 and particle matter 2.5 are considered. The latter was chosen after being identified as the most harmful emission by the EcoSense model. The key output metrics of OSeMBE in REEEM relate to economic, environmental and social impacts of the transition to a low-carbon EU electricity system. They are: 

*	Economic: Discounted investment per citizen, this indicator is available for entire Europe and per country, which allows to compare the investment needs among countries.
*	Environmental: CO2 per citizen. The carbon intensity per citizen allow the comparison in between countries but also the comparison over time. Of interest is not only what the countries might reach in 2050 but also the different starting situations in 2015
*	Social: Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) – do not indicate the final price. However, the LCOE gives a good indication on the cost for electricity generation which have an impact on the final price.
 
Figure XX illustrates the position and the interlinkage of OSeMBE (OSeMOSYS T7.3) with the other modelling tools applied in the project. 

By focusing on the most relevant dynamics in the evolution of the energy system, OSeMBE aims to provide a starting point for policy makers, academia and the public to familiarise with energy systems investment modelling. It constitutes an open source research infrastructure which can serve as a showcase, but also as a starting point for further research. It has been and will be used at in Higher Education Institutions as a ground for 1) teaching kits on energy systems investment modelling, 2) research within Master and PhD theses, 3) flexible and light model base for large numbers of explorative scenario runs (spanning several ranges of uncertainties on future energy prices), 4) open source base for model comparisons at the Energy Modelling Platform for Europe and other European events and 5) model infrastructure to carry out regional or national analyses. For the latter case, scripts are under development within new funded actions to extract regional of national models out of OSeMBE, modify/improve them within the scope of group teaching activities and individual research and re-introduce them into the European model. In short, OSeMBE is not only an engagement model, but also a space for collaborative open research. As such it fulfils the purpose to communicate the features of the modelling effort carried out in REEEM and facilitate the creation of impact.
As the model is smaller and flexible, more than 100 scenarios have been run during the REEEM project to provide the background data for the REEEMgame. 

## REEEMgame

The REEEMgame aims to support learning sessions with stakeholders to provide them with a low-threshold understanding of energy system dynamics. It shows key outcomes and disseminates the data behind a large number of scenarios run with the REEEM Open-source Engagement Model: OSeMBE.
In the current version, you are assigned a specific "point-of-view" expressed as a set of economic, environmental and social preferences. The player mission is simple: make climate policy choices in 2020, 2030, and 2040 to maximize the weighted 2050-score for the assigned preferences. The decisions impact the score components as follows:

*	Economic: Higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2050 is better
*	Social: Cheaper access to energy for everyone in 2050 is better
*	Environmental: Lower annual CO2 emissions in 2050 are better
 
Figure 43. Interface of the REEEMgame.

The game aims to let the player interactively discover how policy decisions, investments in infrastructure and technology developments might affect the development of the European electricity sector in the transition to a low carbon system. At three points in time (2020, 2030, 2040) levers may be changed by the player concerning the emission reduction pathway, the expected capital costs of Renewable Energy Technologies, and the upgrade of the trans-border electricity transmission between European countries, according to the 10-Year development plan by ENTSO-E.

The learning simulation has been run at stakeholder meetings and will also be made available to educational institutions and the general public online.
Stakeholders and partners within the REEEM project have contributed to the learning simulation throughout the development process by providing feedback on design, implementation and testing of the learning simulation.

The REEEMgame can be accessed here, while full documentation is in XX.

## REEEMpathways

Stakeholder engagement in the project builds largely on enabling tools and WP7 has the function of disseminating the insights gained from the project, and to get feedback from stakeholders to improve the models and other material being developed in the project.

To reach this objective an article-based open access online tool, REEEMpathways, has been developed to visualise the results/key messages derived from the integrated impact assessment modelling framework presented in Section 3 and enable stakeholder feedback and interaction.

The tool is populated by data stored in the REEEM Pathways Database and provides public access to modelling insights, input data and pathway assumptions from the project.
The user interface is designed with an emphasis on organising and showing model data on charts. A number of developed features enhance usability and accessibility. Among these, the possibility of downloading the data underlying the charts.

The tool enables REEEM partners to publish and update their own articles providing multiple types of static and dynamic charts to choose from to visualise their own key messages and the data behind it.
 
Figure 44. REEEMpathways interface.

Following the concept of the REEEM project, this allows policy makers and stakeholders to explore and compare possible decarbonisation pathways. This may assist in understanding the effects of and requirements for energy system changes.

The tool has been integrated with social media (Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) and this enables the public to discuss the results/key messages with REEEM partners and allows other modellers to contribute with their knowledge.

The tool can be accessed here while full documentation is available in XX.

## Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E)

Computational models can provide insights into potential decarbonisation pathways, create a ground for consultations and help roadmap long-term strategies. The modelling effort carried out in the REEEM project fulfils this purpose. Yet, it is one of many in Europe and it has limitations like all others. The strength of all these efforts lies in their complementarity, comparability, legacy and possibility to be taken further by future actions. Energy system modelling efforts across Europe are scattered, attempts towards inclusive and structured EU-wide fora bringing researchers and EU policy makers are scarce and transparency of modelling tools is in many cases limited.
With this view, the REEEM project created in 2017 the Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E) as one of its deliverables. The Platform was created with inputs from the European Commission’s Directorate General Energy, Research and Innovation and Joint Research Centre. 

The EMP-E aims to provide a peer-reviewed digest of models and policy insights to inform the transition towards a low-carbon European society, vis-à-vis the Energy Union and Climate objectives. It brings together researchers from across Europe and EU policy makers. It facilitates the transition towards new open and transparent modelling paradigms. The EMP-E constitutes the last ring of the chain leading in REEEM from the co-design of model-based assessment of decarbonisation pathways, to the documentation, simplification for expert and non-expert and finally sharing of outcomes and infrastructure. It does not only constitute a platform for sharing outcomes of the project, but rather for many more efforts to share their outcomes, thereby creating long-lasting impact.

The modelling platform culminates in a yearly event held at the Headquarters of Directorate General Research and Innovation (DG R&I), in Brussels. The first event took place on May 17-18th 2017 and was attended by around 80 participants, from research institutions across Europe, the European Commission and, to a lesser extent, industry. After the success of the first event, the REEEM project opened the organisation of the yearly events to the other projects funded under LCE21-2015, MEDEAS, REflex and SET-Nav, as part of a collaboration started by INEA. Attendance and participation grew and in its third edition the platform is co-organised by 9 funded projects. Its quick transformation into a collegial effort owned by research actions and promoted by the European Commission is a measure of the sustainability and impact of the Platform.

More impact resides in the Special Issue of Energy Strategy Reviews (Elsevier) ‘Energy Transition and Decarbonisation pathways for the EU’. Completed early 2019, it collects outcomes of and hot topics covered at the first EMP-E meeting. This Special Issue does not merely present a collection of articles covering a pre-defined topic. It provides a synthesis of highly complementary tools, practices, experiences and views to inform the research and innovation agenda for the European energy system. The full set of articles provides a holistic view of technical, cross-sectoral, financial, societal challenges of the transition to a low-carbon system. These challenges reflect research questions, highly relevant for national energy agencies and EU decision makers. 

This knowledge repository is available not only as a number of open access articles, but also as a number of freely accessible online toolkits. Among these are toolkits developed within the European Commission, toolkits traditionally employed in scenario analyses for the EU, emerging open source toolkits and ground-breaking new, open databases.

A solid body of research infrastructure emerges, building on vast literature and experiences collected in the past few decades, and clearly moving towards the establishment of standards for: 1) creating open modelling tools and structuring open data sets, 2) make existing and widely-employed modelling tools transparent, 3) juxtaposing new tools to specifically analyse new challenges. 

A large body of manuscripts was submitted by the participants of EMP-E 2017, synthesising decades of research from all over Europe on EU energy system transitions. The final outcome features 22 peer-reviewed articles, of which 10 with unlimited full open access and several presenting results of EU-funded actions.

The Special Issue is introduced by a preface from three Directorates General of the European Commission: Directorate General for Research and Innovation, Directorate General Energy and Directorate General Joint Research Centre.
