Highlighted in its recent long term vision document, A Clean Planet for all - A European long-term strategic vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy, the [11] sets out how the energy system will need to be close to carbon neutral (net zero CO2 emissions) by the middle of the century. Such a transition to a low carbon energy system and economy will transform the production and delivery of energy services, require large-scale investment, and involve a wide range of actors to implement.

There are estimated benefits from the transition, from an increase in employment across specific sectors developing low carbon technology [12], to less reliance on fossil fuels and the associated price volatility, reduced levels of air pollution, and opportunities for lower energy costs through measures improving household insulation. However, it is inevitable that some households and industries more vulnerable to the changes that a rapid and large-scale transition brings could lose out, particularly if adequate mitigating measures are not in place.

Policy needs to mitigate any negative impacts of the transition for two reason; i) to engender buy-in to the transition, and acceptance of policy, and ii) as a basis for addressing underlying structural problems e.g. lack of diversity in a local economy, poorly insulated housing.

## Motivation
Two key ideas around energy vulnerability and distributional impacts have taken root in the climate and energy discourse in recent years: Just Transitions and Energy Poverty. Just Transitions concerns the protection of workers in industries that may be more vulnerable to sustainable development policies. Energy poverty concerns a situation where households are unable to adequately meet their energy needs at an affordable cost.

There remain some key challenges to European policy in developing options for implementation that account for these concepts of energy vulnerability. Firstly, there is an absence of a suite of indicators on vulnerability across Member States that provide a more comprehensive understanding of the location and scale. Secondly, there is no systematic appraisal of distributional impacts in this policy domain, through more disaggregated analysis of impacts across different socio-economic and industrial groups at subnational scales. Thirdly, there is no clear framework for how vulnerability assessment should be taken forward in relation to long term scenarios.

This research proposes a set of vulnerability indicators that help recognise that specific regions of Europe are potential more vulnerable to a low carbon transitions, which can then be used to help translate the implications of different pathways on such vulnerable regions.  This is an important complementary approach to the techno-economic modelling of scenarios (central to REEEM), which would otherwise overlook such issues.

## Concept 

The InVEST tool (Indicators of Vulnerability in Energy System Transitions) aims to tackle the question how do we ensure that modelled pathways used in strategy development reflect concerns over distributional impacts, and recognises vulnerable households and industries?
Based on the framework developed by [13], as shown below, vulnerability is viewed as a function of 
i)	exposure to impacts from the transition, which are based on metrics from the different modelled pathways e.g. energy costs, coal production outlook;
ii)	sensitivity to those impacts, based on the vulnerability indicators associated with industry and households; and
iii)	adaptative capacity, based on features of local resilience or policy measures to mitigate impacts.
 
Figure 20. Vulnerability framework (based on [3]).

## Analysis

Four industry and six household metrics represent ‘sensitivity’ to impacts, and are paired with ‘exposure’ metrics.  For industry sensitivity, this includes regions with higher dependency on coal sector and energy-intensive industry employment. On exposure, model-based metrics on coal production and industrial energy costs are considered. For households, sensitivity indicators include regions who have higher shares of the population experiencing energy affordability issues, as measured in different ways. On exposure, model-based metrics on energy costs and investment levels are considered. Examples of the data used for the vulnerability indicators are shown below, for coal employees.

The spatial distribution of the above coal employee data is shown below.

A concentration of coal production in specific regions primarily in Eastern Europe highlight vulnerabilities to this declining industry. Furthermore, heavy industry also has its regional focus, and suggests perhaps higher levels of exposure to increasing energy prices (downside) but also the prospect of high levels of investment. On the household side, the share of households with problems of adequately heating their homes is highlighted, again with higher shares in Eastern but also Southern Europe. The inter-country disparities are also shown by contrasting deciles 1 and 10.

The above examples and other vulnerability (sensitivity) metrics are normalised and combined with pathway (exposure) metrics , to give an indication of how different pathways may impact different regions. A qualitative assessment of adaptive capacity, including policy action, has been undertaken to identify the actions for addressing negative impacts and building on the opportunities that such transitions can bring.

## Main insights

**Message 11. Specific regions of Europe are more vulnerable to the impacts of low carbon transitions than others**

The low carbon transition will have multiple impacts that are likely to affect different regions of the EU, but to differing extents. To explore these distributional impacts, selected indicators of vulnerability across industry and household sectors have been selected, based on sensitivity to energy cost increases or exposure to reducing demand for goods (in industry). 
We find that specific regions of Europe are potentially more likely to be sensitive to low carbon transitions. For households vulnerable to change, it is the regions of eastern and southern Europe where issues of affordability and energy adequacy are most prominent.  One of the six indicators used to measure this is provided in Figure 1, showing the spatial distribution of households who self-report that they are unable to adequately heat their homes.
Factors giving rise to this vulnerability include insufficiency of heating systems during colder periods of the year (notably in Southern Europe), while in Eastern Europe factors may relate to a range of issues from poor building fabric to inefficient energy systems. Affordability is also a key factor in these regions, where incomes are typically lower than in other EU countries. While there are differences, most of the other metrics used show a similar trend.

On industry, the selected vulnerability indicators relate to the number of employees in the coal sector, and share of manufacturing employment in energy-intensive sectors.  Coal production and generation jobs are highly concentrated, based on regions with large resources, notably Poland and Germany (Figure 2).  Śląskie in Poland (situated in the Silesian basin) is by far the region most dependent on coal mining, accounting for over a quarter of the total sector employees across Europe (which total 400,000). These regions need to be considered; previous transitions suggest that coal phase out could lead to detrimental employment and societal impacts if not managed.  
There are also specific regions of Europe with higher shares of employees in energy intensive industries, which could be subject to higher energy cost pressures, and in some case, competitive pressures from the globalised nature of the sector.  Regions include those located in Eastern Europe, BENELUX, and parts of Scandinavia, where key sectors include primary metals, non-metallic minerals, paper and pulp, and to a lesser extent, chemicals.  These sectors account for some 3 million employees.

There is limited geographical overlap between residential and industry metrics of vulnerability, although some regions do have multiple vulnerabilities. Some coal regions also see higher household energy vulnerability, such as Yugoiztochen (BG), Severozápad (CZ), Śląskie (PL), and Sud-Vest Oltenia (RO). Regions which have both high employment in energy intensive industry sectors and household energy vulnerability include cases in Slovenia, Hungary, Lithuania and Estonia. From a policy perspective, these overlaps are interesting to identify where sensitivities exist across multiple sectors to possible impacts of transitions.  Regions in Spain and Italy are also identified due to their relatively lower disposable incomes and higher levels of unemployment; recognising specific issues around capacity to respond to the low carbon transition (as indicated by these indicators) is important for designing policy and targeting resources.

**Message 12. The ability of households to respond to changes is likely to vary significantly within regions, not only between regions**

This analysis highlights that it is not only the distributional impacts between regions that are important but also those within regions. This is highlighted in Figure 1, which shows that for the metric in question, vulnerability is much higher for income decile 1 (lowest) compared to decile 10 (highest). Taking the example of Greece, decile 10 has an average share of households unable to keep warm at 5%, while the decile 1 has a share of 55%, a very large difference. This pattern is replicated across other member states – and across the most of the household vulnerability metrics. This within-regional variation arises from differences in local economies, incomes, and other factors (local energy systems, building stock, access to services etc.). 
While not investigated in this research, the same is probably true of different industries, which are often highly heterogeneous within a region, with some more prepared for shifting to low carbon production than others. The lack of data at the EU level means that this is challenging to determine.

**Message 13. The REEEM scenarios highlight that energy vulnerable regions may also incur higher energy costs but also the prospects of large investment required to deliver the transition.**

There are no significant differences between scenarios so the Base scenario is used here as representative of all three pathways.

Regions in the red boxed areas of Figure 3 highlight that those most vulnerable (primarily in countries in eastern and southern Europe) also incur the higher investment levels. This increased investment highlights the opportunity that the transition brings to resolving some of the underlying structural problems inherent in driving household energy vulnerability (poor building stock, insufficient heating provision). It is likely that some of these regions see higher investment due to the need for improved efficiency and associated infrastructure. Policy therefore needs to manage the short-term risks of increasing cost, which could impact negatively on affordability, while incentivising and supporting the large-scale investment that is necessary. 
 
Figure 26. Change in investment level in 2030/50 (indexed relative to 2015, vertical axis) under the Base pathway versus current household vulnerability (horizontal axis) as measured by consensual indicators, AdWarmth and SevArrears. Red boxes highlight those regions who are both vulnerable to impacts and see high levels of investment.

The REEEM scenarios do not indicate an increase in energy cost specifically for regions with high employment dependency on energy intensive industries. However, the general trend of the scenarios is to show increasing energy costs and the need for large investments to be made in these industries if they are to remain competitive in a low carbon world, and ensuring that Europe retains its heavy industrial base. Unlike the coal sector, the vulnerability of employment in these regions can be reduced through investment, but which will need to be incentivised through policies, including measures that recognise and reward the low carbon provenance of goods. 

**Message 14. For coal dependent regions, all scenarios show rapid decline in both coal production and generation. Just Transition planning is therefore vital for the affected regions.**

The scenarios see a post-2030 decline that is rapid, with very low or zero output by 2050, meaning that effective planning focused on new opportunity for workers needs to be put in place over the next decade. Unlike other industries, there appear to be no real prospects for keeping these extractive industries in business. While the Paris Agreement scenario shows some increase in CCS application for coal, it is questionable whether such a prospect is realistic in a net-zero emission world.

**Message 15. Recognition that regions differ significantly in terms of vulnerability and capacity to respond, both between and within regions, should be mainstreamed into the policy process.**

A range of policy insights and recommendations emerge from this research. Crucially, recognising vulnerability and the potential for distributional impacts across Europe is a first step to then shaping policy to mitigate negative impacts whilst reinforcing and maximising the positive ones. This means mainstreaming this type of analysis into the impact assessment process; the ESPON developed Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA) approach would be an excellent starting point. 

In addition to adopting a TIA-type approach, the EU could also play a key role in facilitating the gathering of necessary data to better understand regional differences, and the specific factors that make certain regions more or less resilient to change. An excellent1 initiative on energy poverty has been the establishment of an observatory. Such an initiative could be replicated to further explore industry sector vulnerability, the data needed to measure this, and measures to ensure Just Transitions. 

With an enhanced understanding of distributional impacts, an informed policy response can be developed, building on current policy to ensure the necessary support for vulnerable regions. This will be relevant for EU policy but also for member states policy, including that focused and implemented at the regional level.
