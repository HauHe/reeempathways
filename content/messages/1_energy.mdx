The energy system optimization in REEEM is carried out based on the Pan-European TIMES energy system model (TIMES PanEU). The latter is built with the TIMES model generator REF, developed and maintained within the Energy Technology System Analyses Program (ETSAP) of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to carry on policy and scenario analysis based on technical-economic energy system models [18]. TIMES PanEU is a bottom-up linear partial equilibrium model with the complete European energy system for the time horizon from 2010 up to 2050. The model minimizes the energy system cost according to given energy demands, energy technologies and policy requirements. All costs are discounted to the reference year which is used to calibrate the energy balances and technology stocks based on statistical data. TIMES PanEU covers all European Union member states as well as Norway and Switzerland. Each country is modelled as a single region with implemented trading mechanisms enabling exchanges and interactions between these. The model horizon is divided in five-year intervals, with one year comprising twelve time slices (four seasonal and three day levels). The reference energy system of the model represents all energy and material flows across the entire energy system, starting from the supply of resources and ending with fulling different energy demand services. It is split into seven main sectors (supply, electricity and heat production, industry, commercial, residential, agriculture and transport) reacting different demand structures and transformation steps. All sectors can interact with each other and different indicators (e.g. energy use) are calculated through each step in the reference system. To analyze environmental policies, GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) and local air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NOX, SO2, NH3, NMVOC, CO) are included in the model.

The REEEM project aims to develop comprehensive understanding of the implications of the European energy transition towards to a low carbon society. Therefore, one of the objectives of the project is to develop an integrated assessment framework. For this purpose, the existing TIMES PanEU energy system model, explained above, is linked to other modelling and analytical activities (further described in the next sub-sections) and further improved. This advanced version of the TIMES PanEU model constitutes the core of the integrated framework.

The main steps of the development are here summarised: 

1.	Technology innovation outlooks developed in Technology Innovation Roadmaps are integrated, with focus on storage options, renewable energy technologies and heat savings in residential buildings. Those roadmaps provide certain techno-economic figures which are used as input parameters in TIMES PanEU.
2.	An assessment of the health impacts of emissions by the energy sector is carried out. For this purpose, a soft-link is established between TIMES PanEU and EcoSense, where the former takes figures from the latter and uses those as externalities.
3.	A step is moved into accounting for regional and local specificities of the energy system development of selected EU countries. This part builds on a harmonisation process between TIMES PanEU and case study models focusing on energy supply security and grid and dispatch with the help of the experts in the case study regions, existing base year capacities and electricity trade flow between the regions are improved and the planned capacities from the ENTSO-E reports REF are incorporated into the model as well. 
4.	A first step is marked into the inclusion of impacts of consumers’ technology choices onto the achievement of decarbonisation targets in the whole EU. The main drivers of consumers’ choices regarding heating and transportation are drawn from surveys through a novel discrete choice model. Selected insights are included in TIMES PanEU. 
5.	The effect of climate changes on heating and cooling demand across the EU is evaluated starting from climate databases. In turn, the effect of these changes on the energy demand-supply balance and investment requirements is assessed through TIMES PanEU.
6.	Finally, economic impacts of the energy transition are integrated to TIMES PanEU with a soft-link with NEWAGE. In this case, the two models have been coupled, ss certain data flowed back to NEWAGE until the models reached convergence.

The complete model structure, as well as the advancements carried out for the REEEM project are described in REF.

##	Main insights

**Message 1: Breakthroughs in RES technologies could help decarbonise the energy system at a reasonable cost**

Innovation in RES technologies could play a key role in reducing the costs of decarbonisation. Selected breakthroughs in solar and wind technologies, judged likely by experts within the industrial stakeholder’s network of InnoEnergy, are analysed in the project []. One of the breakthrough scenarios is expected in the solar PV industry with the Building Integrated Solar PV technology. Based on the pathway definitions, this breakthrough scenario is applied in the Local Solutions (LS) and Paris Agreement (PA) Pathways (see assumptions in Annex 1). The effect of such a breakthrough is seen in the installed capacity deployment in the electricity sector below.

Another key breakthrough may be in wind offshore, with the diffusion of floating platforms for wind turbines. This is assumed in the Base pathway. According to these figures in [10], offshore wind becomes quite competitive with onshore wind and even with Solar PV. Additionally, the availability factor is higher, due to the higher availability of the resource off the coast. With this competitive advantage, offshore wind has relatively high potential and it is chosen over onshore wind and solar technologies especially after 2030 as a mitigation technology. Another advantage of offshore wind over onshore is the fact that it does not compete with other sectors for land which -especially in the more densely populated countries- can be an issue. This aspect, however, is not captured in this modelling activity. The technological advancements in certain mitigation technologies may have a significant impact on the direction of the energy transition. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that the high variability of most renewable energy technologies needs a more refined temporal resolution in order to capture their dispatchability. The grid and dispatch case study sheds light on whether the suggested capacity expansion can be dispatched in certain South-Eastern European countries. Given the significant effect that such breakthroughs could have, the establishment of supporting mechanisms to expedite their occurrence could be a way for the transition to materialize sooner and at a lower cost.

### Variations by pathway
It is clear that the consideration of breakthroughs in the modelling leads to a higher share in the final capacity mix. In the Base pathway where breakthroughs are not considered, the solar capacity in 2050 is 217GW while in the Local Solutions and Paris Agreement 611 and 636 respectively. In general, the share in those pathways is almost similar which is indication that solar could play a major in a deep decarbonisation scenario.

**Message 2: Power generation capacity expected to rise**

In all three pathways, the total capacity of the power system is expected to rise. This can be attributed to the fact that decarbonisation leads to higher demand for renewable electricity. The latter has in principle lower capacity factor than the fossil fuels and nuclear and thus, higher capacity is needed to meet the same demand. The power generation capacity expansion will cause changes to the system. Those changes could be of either operational or economic nature. From an operational point of view, the higher share of renewables will make the system more susceptible to variability which needs addressing from an institutional point of view (e.g. integration of smart grids). For this reason, the model suggests that a certain capacity of natural gas will remain in the system even in 2050, to be used as a backup option, with much reduced full-load hours compared to today. From an economic point of view, this transition will cause the system to shift its cost from operational to capital. This requires a shift in the financing schemes and whether the consumer funds the investment directly or indirectly, depends on the level of system decentralisation. Figure XX shows the energy mix in terms power generation for the three pathways.

### Variations by pathway
In the LS pathway, the centralized technologies are limited to support the motivation of the pathway. This means that the nuclear power plant deployment, together with the CCS power plant options are not allowed except for the already planned capacities. Therefore, the system is forced to move towards decentralized generations, like Building Integrated Solar PV which leads to higher power generation capacity compared to the Base pathway; although, these two pathways have the same reduction targets at the EU level overall. However, because of the full load hours of the decentralized technologies, lower electricity generation is observed in the Local Solutions compared to Base. In the PA pathway, the overall power generation is higher compared to the other two, with all sectors contributing. This would probably mean that an ambitious decarbonisation target such as that proposed in the Paris Agreement, would require coordinated effort by different institutes as, for example, the electrification of industry could rely more on self-funding by the industries themselves rather than the government. The latter requires huge investments for which new financial mechanisms would have to be established.

**Message 3: Biomass appears to have a significant share in the energy generation – Implications must be examined**

As shown in Figure X1, X2, Xe and X4, biomass increases its share in the energy mix in all sectors. Biomass and the energy carriers based on biomass can be defined as mitigation options in different parts of the energy system.  However, the exploitable potential of biomass depends on a plethora of local constraints which are not necessarily captured at a national level. One of these factors relates to the intensity of biomass use. Trade-offs with other sectors in which the use of biomass is imperative need be examined as part of energy planning. The REEEM case study on ecosystem services reveals such trade-offs and suggests different mixes for the allocation of forestry resources.

### Variations by pathway

The utilisation of biomass seems to be consistently cost-competitive across decarbonisation pathways. The balance of use across sectors may vary according to where policies or consumers’ attitudes drive the decarbonisation effort most.  In the Base, it is mainly utilized in the industry sector, as shown in Figure X, while in LS, the priority is given to the transport sector to meet the pathway, sector-specific targets. On the other hand, in the PA pathway, priority is given to the electricity sector due to biomass CCS availability as a mitigation option, in the PA which is illustrated in Figure X and Figure X . The available amount of biomass in the different sectors is a critical point in the transition. 
Additionally, environmental heat and especially solar thermal grow rapidly in the LS scenario to fulfil the local solution decarbonization targets in the residential segment. Due to the different structure of the pathways, the allocation of renewables differs as well. The aforementioned technologies could have an even higher contribution to the total energy generation according to given decarbonization targets.
The 80% share of renewables in the gross final energy consumption is achieved only in the PA pathway. With potential reduction in the amount of biomass that can be considered as exploitable (when trade-offs with other sectors are better examined), the achievement of the renewable energy target will become even more infeasible.

**Message 4: The marginal cost of the last 5% decarbonisation to reach net zero emissions may be very high / Heavy industry and some segments of transportation may be the hardest to decarbonise**

Despite the fact that every sector contributes to decarbonisation, the achievement of a zero-emission system seems infeasible. This is due to the fact that industry, maritime and aviation have -based on the current technology available and assumed development trends- certain limits with regards to how much they can eliminate the use of fossil fuels. One could argue that further investments in RnD could potentially lead to technological solutions that allow the complete decarbonisation of the aforementioned sectors. This raises a critical question: “Would the benefits from complete system decarbonisation offset the economic burden created”. Given that 80-95% decarbonisation seems already feasible, the marginal benefits of reaching 100% rate must be examined carefully.

### Variations by pathway

Due to different sectoral targets in the Base and LS pathways, the priority is given to the industry in Base, and to the residential, commercial and transport sector in LS to decarbonise. The other sectors which are not part of the specific targets, have the opportunity to decarbonise less and thus, they benefit from additional reductions. These benefits are visible in the sectoral CO2 emission levels.

According to Figure 5, the industry level emissions are quite similar in the Base and PA pathways which means that the industry bounds actually pushed forward the industry to reduce to maximum based on the future described in the Base pathway. Oppositely, LS pathway is less willing to decarbonise the industry due to the additional targets in the residential and transport sector. This provides extra space for the industry as some of the industry related emissions also belong to Non-ETS emissions. 

Sectoral integration is also visible with the share of the electricity in different sectors based on the decarbonization targets and the available potential of the other sources. Higher level of electrification is observed in the Base pathway in industry (Figure 3) compared to LS. On the other hand, electrification is higher in the residential (Figure 4) and commercial sectors in LS compared to Base. Additionally, the highest electrification is observed in all the sectors in the PA scenario with the availability of the different mitigation technologies in electricity to achieve the highest target in the energy transition. The higher electrification can be seen in the Final Energy Consumption graph with the highest share.
