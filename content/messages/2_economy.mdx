The main tool to analyse the economic impacts of the transition to a low-carbon energy system was NEWAGE (National European World Applied General Equilibrium) REF. NEWAGE is a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that divides the World in 18 regions, being 9 of them inside the EU, 18 production sectors and 4 production factors. The model presents a disaggregated electricity generation sector, with 18 different technologies.
Being a macroeconomic model enables NEWAGE to capture the interaction between different sectors of the economy. One of the main outputs, for example, is how a carbon tax can influence sectoral production by increased energy costs, or how consumers react to price changes of energy goods. Ultimately, NEWAGE is capable of indicating how the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country or region is likely to increase or decrease for a given policy.
Under the scope of the REEEM integrated framework, the main modelling activities performed were the coupling of NEWAGE with TIMES-PanEU and the disaggregation of the households’ sectors in NEWAGE into 5 representative household groups. For the former, the main steps were:

1.	Calibration of NEWAGE over a Reference scenario;
2.	Definition of parameters to be transferred from TIMES Pan-EU to NEWAGE and vice-versa:
    a.	From TIMES-PanEU to NEWAGE:
        i.	Sectoral emissions (calibration)
        ii.	Electricity generation by technology (coupling process)
    b.	From NEWAGE to TIMES-PanEU:
        i.	Sectoral production (coupling process)
        ii.	GDP (coupling process)
3.	Interface for data transferring between the two models;
4.	Iterative coupling between the two models.

Although not present on the scope of the REEEM project, the Reference scenario was added to the coupling process between NEWAGE and TIME-PanEU for a couple of reasons. First, NEWAGE does not produce predictions, but does scenario analysis, so the Reference scenario is as a starting point, from which the counterfactual scenarios will be compared to. In order to create this scenario, we chose the EU Reference Scenario 2016, which contained GDP, emissions and population projections until 2050 and calibrated NEWAGE to be able to generate similar results when running under the Reference scenario configuration. Additionally, in the framework of the model coupling, TIMES-PanEU was also calibrated according to the Reference scenario in order to ensure that both models had compatible assumptions regarding technology development and ensured the convergence between them.

With the coupling, two objectives were reached. First, NEWAGE was made capable of assimilating the detailed technology information contained in TIMES-PanEU and, second, TIMES-PanEU was able to respond to energy demand shifts caused by changes on sectoral production levels.

The households’ disaggregation had the objective of gaining deeper understanding on the impacts of carbon taxation on groups of different incomes, shedding light on potential winners and losers of the energy transition. Important results from this analysis are the share of income dedicated to energy goods per household group and its effects on energy poverty.

The analysis of economic impacts covers the Coalitions for a low carbon path (below CLC), the Local solutions (LS) and Paris Agreement (PA) pathways.  A sensitivity was also created, assuming fulfilment of the Paris Agreement merely by the EU and not the rest of the world (PA – EU). A summary of the key characteristics of the analysed pathways is given in Table XX. For the analysis, the qualitative assumptions on global effort towards decarbonisation reported in the description of the pathways (Section 1.4) are turned into quantitative inputs for NEWAGE. In the Coalition to a low carbon path and Local solution pathways it is assumed that the EU-28 has a target to decrease its CO2 emissions by 80% until 2050, compared to 1990 levels, while the global push to climate change mitigation is assumed to be driven by some regions/countries. In the Paris Agreement pathway, the EU-28 has a target to decrease its CO2 emissions by 95% until 2050, compared to 1990 levels, where an indistinct global push is assumed instead. For the special case of Paris Agreement – EU pathway, the 95% target is kept, but the rest of the World follows the same emission targets as in Coalitions for a low carbon path and Local solutions. Further information on the economic impacts derived from the REEEM analysis can be found in REF. More details on the assumptions regarding emission trajectories outside the EU are given in Appendix A.

## Main insights

**Message 5: GDP growth is expected to continue, but could be hindered by decarbonisation**

On a broader level (ie without looking into winners and losers), the EU economy will continue to grow under the transition to a low carbon pattern. As illustrated in the GDP growth graph Figure XXa, GDP rises at a steady pace every decade, reaching a total of 55-72% in 2050 compared to 2011 levels. However, economic growth could be hindered in the cases where the highest decarbonisation effort is pursued, as shown in Figure xxb.

Figure 12. a) Relative growth compared to 2011; b) Difference to Reference Scenario.

Compared to 2011, On a European level, the Local solutions pathway delivered lower GDP growth by the year 2040 in comparison to other scenarios, indicating that taxing consumers, transportation and services is the least efficient of the presented strategies. The cause relies in that services comprehend more than 70% of European economic activity [https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/eaec/html/index.en.html] and the European consumers are the main target of goods produced within the EU. Consequently, an unbalanced carbon taxation policy, as in the Local solutions pathway, decreases European GDP growth by imposing a high burden on consumers and, thus, decreasing their consumption of locally produced goods. However, in the last 10 years of the analysis, the lowest GDP growth is recorded in the Paris Agreement pathway. This can be attributed to the more ambitious targets set, which require more drastic measures that seem to have a negative impact on the economy. Nevertheless, even when examining the worst case, the maximum relative difference to the CLC scenario is around 6%, which is not dramatic considering the fact that there is a global action towards the Paris Agreement’s goal and, thus, other regions will also experience lower GDP growth. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that factors such as technology or demography which, so far in the future as 2050, are governed by a high level of uncertainty, could potentially have an even greater impact on the economy than decarbonisation.

Paris agreement – EU and Paris Agreement have similar GDP development until 2035. However, on years 2045 and 2050 Paris Agreement – EU has much higher GDP development than Paris Agreement. This is due to the fact that under the Paris Agreement pathway it is expected a lower economic activity in the other regions due to higher expenditure on climate protection. Furthermore, GDP development under the Paris Agreement – EU, despite having a higher decrease of European CO2 emissions than the Coalitions for a low carbon path and Local solutions pathways, still has a higher development than these scenarios because of its carbon taxation scheme, which shares the burden more evenly among the players of the economy.  Although these results might seem negative for the PA pathway, it is important to remember that until 2040, the PA pathway had GDP development very similar to the other scenarios and only diverged on the last two-time steps. Considering that these time steps are over 25 years in the future, there is enough time to prepare and adapt for this scenario.

**Message 6: Different sectors may grow at a different pace**

The analysis shows that the contribution of every sector to the economic growth will increase. In other words, as shown in Figure XX, the Gross Value Added (GVA) of every sector is expected to increase, though at different rates. The chemical industry for example, seems to record the lowest growth potential. Reason being that industries like this and the non-ferrous metals are sectors focused on the European market. Thus, they grow according to the EU’s own economic growth and, in addition, the European chemical sector has been stagnant for the last 10 years, so a 20% growth can be still considered positive. Since those sectors are oriented towards the internal EU market, we can expect that their growth trend follows that of the EU, considering that they keep their market share. However, with new competition entering the EU, it is plausible that they record relative losses.  In other words, their growth is expected to be hindered by foreign competition. On the downside, sectors that are more export oriented, such as that of non-metallic minerals are expected to record higher economic growth due to the higher economic growth potential outside the EU.
 
Figure 13. Competitiveness index (GVA) development.

### Variations by pathway

When looking into industrial production in the EU, the results indicate that for the Paris Agreement pathway, sectors which are strongly oriented to exports, such as vehicles and machinery, have a lower GVA in 2050 compared to the other scenarios, due to lower economic activity in the rest of the world. 
In some sectors, the Reference scenario shows lower growth compared to the other scenarios (e.g. iron and steel), while in others higher. This can be attributed to the fact that since they are export oriented, the higher the (relative to the EU) economic growth outside the EU, the more they benefit. 
Vehicle, Machinery and rest of industry are sectors that are not energy intensive. Therefore, they do not suffer in the CLC, LS and PA_EU pathway, but are quite export oriented, so they are negatively affected in the PA pathway, because economic activity in other regions decreases. As for chemicals, non-ferrous metals and the paper sector which are energy intensive and more oriented for internal consumption, they follow the overall European economic tendency.
Message 7: Uneven GDP growth across member states
With very few exceptions, every other country/region will see a lower economic growth in a decarbonisation scenario compared to the Reference case. Figure XX shows that the economy Germany and Northern Europe will be affected the least from decarbonisation, compared to all other regions. This can be explained by the fact that those countries currently record a relatively low per capita, emission rate and have already decarbonised their systems significantly compared to 1990.  Therefore, the remaining burden for them is consequently lower.
 
Figure 14. ???.

### Variations by pathway

In the Coalitions for a low carbon path pathway where decarbonisation targets are lower in particular regions, Poland and the South and Eastern European countries are affected less than the rest in terms of economic growth. On the other hand, the fulfilment of the Paris Agreement will have more severe effects on almost every region, with Italy, Poland, the UK and Ireland suffering the most. This is due to the more ambitious targets which have a direct economic effect on those regions that currently have higher emission rates.
